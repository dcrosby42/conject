ISSUE 2012-04-25: construct_with cyclic dependency checking!  Eg. Presenter construc_with :presenter -> stack overlow
ISSUE 2012-04-30: prevent #put for already-existant objects
ISSUE 2012-04-30: prevent #configure_object(s) for already-existant objects
ISSUE 2013-01-20: Better error handling in ObjectFactory when .new fails! see below
ISSUE 2013-01-20: Use __send__ instead of send; it brokes. (class_ext_construct_with)

Features:
  Provide option in ObjectContext to disable automatic building of dependencies.
    Ie, if a dependency doesn't already exist in this context or any parent, raise an error.
    This would help when using contexts in unit tests where you want tests to fail when someone sneaks new deps into a class (otherwise, Conject will just build you a real one and let er rip)
    This implies some refactoring of ObjectContext and ObjectFactory
      NOTES:
        - object_factory.rb line 41 installs the object context into the newly built object: 1) use Conject.install_object_context, and 2) move this into ObjectContext around line 34.
        - redesign ObjectFactory to be a chain of potential object generators, where each one considers the object config and decides whether or not to produce.
          The default chain looks like this: [ Alias | Lambda | Specified Class | Classic Auto Construction ]
        - Move ObjectFactory#type_1_constructor and #anchor_object_peers into their own class; is common between the last two object producers 
        - provide mechanism to reconfigure the object producer chain
          - reorder
          - remove some / all
          - add stock
          - add custom, either an object or a function ?
          - provide a "mock" generator, such that new mock objects are produced based on the requested name?

  Class singletons:
    use_class_in_context
    class_depends_on

  ObjectContext#no_cache? <- reimplement for recursive upward search of object configs
    (Feb 15 2013: I don't remember what this note means)

  contexts can accept configurations targeted at named subcontext

  Conject.new_object_context (support no-args, default parent context to nil)
